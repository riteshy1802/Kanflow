# Kanflow: Modern Task and Team Management System

**Kanflow** is a powerful web-first task and team management application designed for streamlined collaboration, productivity, and task tracking. It is built using Django for the backend and Next.js (with TypeScript) for the frontend, leveraging PostgreSQL (via NeonDB) for persistent storage. The system supports smooth client-server communication using React Query and integrates several modern libraries for rich UI and efficient workflows.
